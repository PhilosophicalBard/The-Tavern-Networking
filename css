/* Thoughts for future ref.

---- I want the page to look like a front door with "notices" of paper posted to the door
- When you click a piece of paper it will open a window same page zoomed in
- You can click an x button to close out the window back to the main page
- The words at the top of the door will say Welcome to The Tavern
- You can knock on the door by pressing on the handle to "enter"
- a popup will say are you registered to the tavern?
- Log-in Form / Underneath a link to click - link opens a secondary window popup
- secondary window will popup registration form
- users will need to confirm email before being able to log in



-----------------
upon logging in, there will be a scene with tables/a bar/ an ai behind the bar "maid"
there will be a billboard with notices on it for members of the tavern
there will be a table you can sit at to open a popup window for the tavern public chat
there will be stairs you can click in order to go to a private chat window
you may ask the maid to teleport you to the forums
you may ask the maid for information regarding the private rooms - generates a list-
to log out, talk to the maid and select log out

-----------------------------------
the public chat room will have discord integration for gamers to find parties for their games they are currently playing
the private chats are for topic specific, created by members for their guilds/clans/friends/etc

-------------------------
each popup window is seperate from the website so they "pop out"
overlay options integrated in the future, always on top, opacity % etc

 list-style-image: url("logo.jpg");
   list-style-position: inside; 
   for using the ink-drop icon for lists
   
   cursor: url('images/my-cursor.png'), auto;
   for custom cursors
