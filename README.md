# The-Tavern-Networking
Work in progress towards building the business. 
As I study, will be updating the code.




So as I am reading the HTML, CSS and XHTML for dummies book it reccomended that you plan out your website.

So here we go~

My website is going to be a place for my community. 
Like minded individuals will understand it. 

I want there to be a scene like walking down that one staight path in a forest but it is endless.
On either side of the path there are trees as far as the eye can see.

There will be a thought bubble that pops up saying "Now you find yourself here, would you like to wander my dear?"

If you select yes the scene will not change because the forest surrounds you.
After selecting yes a random scroll will drop from a bird.

Now you have a choice, you can click the scroll to open it or you can toss it to the ground, mind you if you toss it to the ground it will ask you, "Would you like to go back from where you started or would you like to continue walking throught the forest?"

Each option gives you a decision.
You can open the letter and be invited to the tavern with a link to go directly there as per the invitation.
"The Tavern welcomes you humble guest, to explore what it means to thrive in a community of wonder and imagination"

Or you can continue wandering through the forest reading signs about where to go but always given the option to turn back and never make it to your desitnation. Yet if you are curious enough you would continue forward even if you don't initially accept the direct invitiation or the direct link to the place you seek.

IF you continue to go backwards it will eventually say, do you even want to go this way ? Your answer being no will send you back to whatever search engine you used to locate the initial site.

If your answer is yes you will eventually come across and old looking "tavern" in the middle of the forest.
Regardless you have come to the same destination as you would have if you took the risk to open the letter.
Yet this is of your own choosing to continue through the prompts being stubbborn like most people.

At the front door you can knock but someone will ask for your invitation, if you've tossed it aside you shouldn't have access~
If you have the invitation the door will open for you no questions asked.
If you tossed it aside it will ask you, did you come here by choice and if you think about it the answer should be yes, so you will gain permission to enter the tavern. 

If your answer is no then you would be asked, well are you curious to see what's inside.
Yes = entry
No = well I do hope you can see we mean no harm, enjoy your life no matter where you go and take our blessings because we will miss you.

Once you enter the tavern you will be able to see a billboard and a bar with a bartender (rose)
The billboard is your hub of information with the community inside the tavern.

The bartender/maid (rose) will ask you what you seek to find during your time.
No matter the answer she will reccomend you take a look at the billboard.

From the billboard you can go to the forums, you may enter the private rooms created by others to hangout and enjoy your friends, you may see people searching for companions in game or companions in life (will need to allow location services) 

Essentially the tavern is to meet people of all walks of life, to learn about a different culture or way of thinking, to enjoy someone's different perspective about life itself.

You can also see advertisements on the billboard about jobs/games/communities or etc\
Whatever your fantasy is and whatever you're seeking out of life, you should be able to find like minded people within the tavern.

The Tavern is a Network established to bring people together in the sense of living life for the purpose of living not for the purpose of meeting any expectation someone else held above you head.

Self healing is self progression and you can find all the tools needed to form that thought here.
We welcome everyone at the tavern so long as your intentions are for the highest good an truth out of love and not fear.

------------------
There will be a scroll popup upon entering the tavern to sign into the registar (register) to the community
You can build your personal profile within a fantasy realm and also within a reality
This way you can make a resume for future jobs or you can create a resume for future games etc ~

The purpose is to outsource yourself to the world so everyone can see you being yourself.
The purpose is to change the thought process behind expectations
The purpose is to bring people together as one whole not segregated
The purpose is to change the world, one thought at a time.

Welcome to the tavern, if you've made it this far, no you're apart of an altruistic gang, where we kill people with kindness.
Enjoy
